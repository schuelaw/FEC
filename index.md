## [Federal Election Commission](https://www.fec.gov/)
Its mission statement as given on the commission website is: *The FEC was created to promote confidence and participation in the democratic process. Read more about the FEC’s history, purpose and goals.*

### FEC Data

As part of that mission, the FEC collects data about contributions to all candidates in federal elections. Here we explore the FEC data on individual contributions to Joe Biden and Donald Trump during the two year period from Jan 1, 2019 through Dec 31, 2020. That data is available for download from the FEC's [bulk data page](https://www.fec.gov/data/browse-data/?tab=bulk-data).
